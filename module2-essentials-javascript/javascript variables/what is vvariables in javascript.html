what is avariables in javascript ?
 A variables is stored information about data i.e called variables 
 
 Javascript variables denoted via ...

 a) var a=10;
 b) const b=10;
 c) let c="brijesh";
 

 var : var is used to reusales and redeclared the values of any data.

 or
 var is reasined and redeclared the data 

   var a=10;
   var a=10;




   let is used to reasined but can't redeclared the values when we used let. 

   let a=10;
   let a=10;

      

   const : we can't reasigned and redeclared the values const does nor change the values.



   Note : we can't take variables name with reserved keyword 

         We  can't start any variables with numeric 

         We can'nt provides a whitespace in any variables.
         
         examples :  var a=10;
                     a var=10;
                     var ab=10;
                     var a b=10; 
                     var if=10;
                     var name=20;
                     var nm=20;
